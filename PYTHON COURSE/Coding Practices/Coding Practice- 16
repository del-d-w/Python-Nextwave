05. First Prime Number from M to N

Given two Numbers M and N. Write a program to print the first prime number M to N. If no prime numbers are present 
from M to N print No prime numbers in the given range.

Note
• A Prime Number is a positive number greater than 1 that has no factors other than 1 and itself.
• Factors of N:
  • If a number N is divisible by X, then X is a factor of N.
    ■ Example:
      ■ If N = 15 and X = 3, then 3 is a factor of 15 as 15 is divisible by 3.
      ■ If N = 15 and X = 7 then 7 is not a factor of 15 as 15 is not divisible by 7.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing M. The second line of input contains an integer representing N

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer representing the first prime number from M to N . 
If no prime numbers are present from M to N, the string No prime numbers in the given range should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given numbers are
M = 25 and N = 50,
• The numbers that have no factors other than 1 and itself from 25 to 50 are 29, 31, 37, 41, 43 and 47.

06. GCD

Given two numbers M and N N, write a program to print the Greatest Common Divisor (G.C.D) of the numbers M and N.

Note:

• The greatest common divisor (G.C.D) of two numbers is the largest positive factor that perfectly divides the two given numbers.
• Factors of N:
   • If a number N is divisible by X, then X is a factor of N.
      ■ Example:
        ■ If N = 15 and X = 3, then 3 is a factor of 15 as 15 is divisible by 3.
        ■ If N = 15 and X = 7, then 7 is not a factor of 15 as 15 is not divisible by 7.

Quick Tip
The greatest common divisor (G.C.D) will be between 1 and the minimum number of the given two numbers.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing M
The second line of input contains an integer representing N

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the GCD of the numbers M and N.

07. Identify the Mistake - Shape

Given two numbers M and N, write a program to print the Least Common Multiple (L.C.M) of the numbers M and N.

Note:

• The least common multiple (L.C.M) of two numbers is the smallest positive factor that is perfectly divisible by the two given numbers.
• A multiple of a number is a number that is the product of a given number and some other number.
  • Example : 7 X 2 = 14, 14 is a multiple of 7.

Quick Tip
A least common multiple always starts from the maximum number of the given two numbers.

Input
