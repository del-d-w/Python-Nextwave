Question: Sum of two numbers - 3
In this problem, you need to write a program that takes two numbers as input and returns the sum of those two numbers. The code will have a function
called add that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Define a function called add that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
Read the input numbers from the user.
Call the add function with the input numbers and print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Define the function

First, we need to define a function called add that takes two arguments, arg_1 and arg_2. Inside the function, we will calculate the sum of the two arguments 
and store it in a variable called result. Finally, we will return the result variable.

Step 2: Read the input numbers

Now, we need to read the input numbers from the user. We will use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer. 
We will store the first number in a variable called a and the second number in a variable called b.

Step 3: Call the function and print the result

Finally, we will call the add function with the input numbers a and b. The function will return the sum of the two numbers, which we will store 
in a variable called result. Then, we will print the result variable.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

def add(arg_1, arg_2):
    result = arg_1 + arg_2
    return result

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
result = add(a, b)
print(result)

Question: Printing Message
Approach
Step 1: Read the input values
Step 2: Create the message function
Step 3: Call the message function

Question: Printing Message
In this coding question, you are given a person's name and age as input. Your task is to write a function that takes these two inputs and prints a message 
in the format: <name> is <age> years old.

For example, if the given person's name is "Akhil" and the age is 15, your code should print the message: Akhil is 15 years old.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input values (name and age) from the user.
Create a function called message that takes two arguments (name and age) and prints the message in the required format.
Call the message function with the input values.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Read the input values

First, we need to read the input values from the user. We will use the input() function to read the input and store the name and age in two separate variables.

Here, we use input() to read the name (a string) and age (an integer). We convert the age input to an integer using the int() function.

Step 2: Create the message function

Next, we will create a function called message that takes two arguments: arg_1 (name) and arg_2 (age). Inside the function, we will create a string 
called msg that combines the name and age in the required format. Then, we will print the msg string.

In this function, we use the + operator to concatenate the name, age, and other parts of the message. We also convert the age back to a string using the 
str() function so that we can concatenate it with the other strings.

Step 3: Call the message function

Finally, we will call the message function with the input values (name and age) that we read earlier.

This will print the message in the required format.

Here is the complete solution for the given problem:

This code reads the input values, creates a function to print the message, and calls the function with the input values.

Solution:

def message(arg_1, arg_2):
    msg = arg_1 + " is " + str(arg_2) + " years old."
    print(msg)

name = input()
age = int(input())
message(name, age)

Question: Win or Lose or Draw - 2

In this coding question, you are given two numbers A and B which represent the scores of two teams. Your task is to write a program that compares 
the scores and returns "Win" if A is greater than B, "Draw" if A and B are equal, and "Lose" if A is less than B.

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input values for A and B.
Create a function to compare the scores of A and B.
Print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input values

First, we need to read the input values for A and B. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Create a function to compare the scores

Now, let's create a function called compare that takes two arguments, team_a_points and team_b_points. Inside the function, we will use conditional 
statements to compare the scores and return the result.

In this function, we first check if team_a_points is greater than team_b_points. If it is, we set the result variable to "Win". If not, 
we check if team_a_points is equal to team_b_points. If they are equal, we set the result variable to "Draw". If neither of these conditions 
is true, it means that team_a_points is less than team_b_points, so we set the result variable to "Lose". Finally, we return the result variable.

Step 3: Print the result

Now that we have our compare function, we can call it with the input values team_a_points and team_b_points and store the result in a variable called compare_result.
Finally, we can print the compare_result variable to display the output.

Here's the complete solution for this coding question:

Solution:

def compare(team_a_points, team_b_points):
    if team_a_points > team_b_points:
        result = "Win"
    
    elif team_a_points == team_b_points:
        result = "Draw"
    
    else:
        result = "Lose"
        
    return result

team_a_points = int(input())
team_b_points = int(input())

compare_result = compare(team_a_points, team_b_points)

print(compare_result)

Explanation:

For example, if the given M is 3 and N is 5, the sum of squares of 3, 4 and 5 is 50. So the output should be 50.

Tutorial: Sum of Squares from M to N - 2

Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to solve the "sum of squares of numbers from M to N-2". coding question using Python step by step. 

Step 1: Understand the problem
Our task is to create a function named sum_of_squares_m_to_n that takes two numbers, M and N, and returns the sum of squares from M to N. 
For example, if M = 3 and N = 5, the sum of squares of 3, 4, and 5 is 50. So the output should be 50.

Step 2: Create the function
Let's start by creating a function named sum_of_squares_m_to_n that takes two numbers, M and N, as its input:

Step 3: Initialize a variable to store the sum
Inside the function, create a variable called total and set it to zero. We'll use this variable to store the sum of the squares as we loop through the numbers:

Step 4: Loop through the numbers
Now, let's create a loop that goes through each number from M to N, including N. We'll use the range() function to create this loop:

Step 5: Add the square of the number to the total
Inside the loop, let's add the square of the current number i to our total. We can square a number by using the ** operator:

Step 6: Return the total sum
After the loop finishes, our total variable will have the sum of squares from M to N. So, we can return this value from our function:

Step 7: Read input values
Now, let's read the input values for M and N using the input() function and convert them to integers using the int() function:

Step 8: Call the function and print the result
Finally, let's call our sum_of_squares_m_to_n function with the input values M and N, store the result in a variable called result, and print the result:

Sample Input 1:

3
5

Sample Output 1:

50

Sample Input 2:

    total = 0
    for i in range(m, n+1):
        total += (i**2)
    return total
    
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
result = sum_of_squares_m_to_n(m, n)
print(result)

Step 3: Iterate through the range of numbers
Step 4: Check if a number is odd
Step 5: Convert the list to a string
Step 6: Read input and call the function

Question: Print Odd Numbers from M to N - 2

Write a program to print all the odd numbers from M to N separated by a space. The program should read two numbers M and N as input 
and output a single line containing a string of odd numbers from M to N separated by a space.

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Define a function that takes two numbers M and N as arguments.
Create a list to store odd numbers.
Iterate through the range of numbers from M to N.
Check if a number is odd, and if it is, add it to the list.
Convert the list of odd numbers to a string separated by spaces.
Read the input values for M and N, call the function, and print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Define the function
First, let's define a function called get_odd_numbers_in_range that takes two arguments, start_number and end_number. 
This function will return a string containing all the odd numbers between start_number and end_number separated by spaces.

Step 2: Create a list to store odd numbers
Inside the function, create an empty list called odd_numbers_list to store the odd numbers we find.

Step 3: Iterate through the range of numbers
Now, we need to iterate through the range of numbers from start_number to end_number. We can use a for loop for this purpose.

Step 4: Check if a number is odd
Inside the for loop, we need to check if the current number each_number is odd. We can do this by checking if the remainder of the number 
when divided by 2 is 1. If it is, we add the number to our odd_numbers_list.

Step 5: Convert the list to a string
After the loop, we need to convert our odd_numbers_list to a string separated by spaces. We can use the join() function to do this.
Finally, we return the space_separated_odd_numbers string from our function.

Step 6: Read input and call the function
Now, we need to read the input values for M and N, call our get_odd_numbers_in_range function with these values, and print the result.
Here's the complete solution for the problem:

Sample Input 1:

2
7

Solution:

def get_odd_numbers_in_range(start_number, end_number):

    odd_numbers_list = []

    for each_number in range(start_number, end_number + 1):
        if each_number % 2 == 1:
            odd_numbers_list += [str(each_number)]
    
    space_separated_odd_numbers = " ".join(odd_numbers_list)

    return space_separated_odd_numbers

start_number = int(input())
end_number = int(input())

odd_numbers = get_odd_numbers_in_range(start_number, end_number)

print(odd_numbers)
