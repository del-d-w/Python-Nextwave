01. Number of Digits from M to N

Given two numbers M and N, write a program to print the count of the total number of digits from M to N.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing M.
The second line of input contains an integer representing N

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the count of the total number of digits from M to N.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are
M = 4 and N = 13,
• Numbers from 4 to 13 are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
• The number of digits in each number from 4 to 9 is 1. So, the total count of digits from 4 to 9 is 6.
• The number of digits in each number from 10 to 13 is 2. So, the total count of digits from 10 to 13 is 8.
• The total number of digits is 14. (6 +8 = 14 )
The output should be 14.

Sample Input 1:

4
13

Sample Output 1:

14

Sample Input 2:

5
8

Sample Output 2:

4

Solution

m=int(input())
n=int(input())
total_digits_count=0
for number in range(m,n+1):
    total_digits_count=total_digits_count+len(str(number))
print(total_digits_count)

02. Divisible by 6

Given two numbers M and N write a program to find the count of numbers from M to N that are divisible by 6.

Print No Numbers Found if the count of numbers from M to N that are divisible by 6 is 0. Otherwise, 
print the numbers from M to N that are divisible by 6 separated by a space.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing M. The second line of input contains an integer representing N.

Output
The output should be a single line containing the string. No Numbers Found should be printed 
if the count of numbers from M to N that are divisible by 6 is 0. Otherwise, space-separated 
numbers from M to N that are divisible by 6 should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are M = 6 and N = 23,
• The numbers from 6 to 23 that are divisible by 6 are 6, 12, and 18.
• So, the count of numbers from 6 to 23 that are divisible by 6 is 3.
• The string obtained after joining the numbers from 6 to 23 that are divisible by 6 with a space is 6 12 18.
The output should be 6 12 18.

Sample Input 1:

6
23

Sample Output 1:

6 12 18 

Sample Input 2:

2
5

Sample Output 2:

No Numbers Found

Solution

m=int(input())
n=int(input())
count=0
numbers_divisible_by_6=""
for number in range(m,n+1):
    if number%6==0:
        count=count+1
        numbers_divisible_by_6=numbers_divisible_by_6+str(number)+" "
if count==0:

03. Vowles of a String - 2

Given a string, write a program to find the count of Vowels in the string.
Print String has more than two vowels if the count of Vowels is greater than 2. Otherwise, print String doesn't have more than two vowels.
Note
The vowels are a, e, i, o and u.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string. String has more than two vowels should
be printed if the count of Vowels in the string is greater than 2. Otherwise, String doesn't 
have more than two vowels should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given string is indian,
• The characters in the string indian are i, n, d, i, a, and n.
• The Vowels in the string indian are i, i, and a.
• So, the count of Vowels in string indian is 3. (3 is greater than 2)
The output should be String has more than two vowels, as the number of Vowels in the string indian is greater than 2.

Sample Input 1:

indian

Sample Output 1:

String has more than two vowels

Sample Input 2:

code

Sample Output 2:

String doesn't have more than two vowels

Print Indivisible Number if the number N is not divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to 9.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string. Divisible Number should be printed 
if the number N is divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to 9. Indivisible Number should
