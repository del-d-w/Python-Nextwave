02. Basic Arithmetic

Write a program to take two integer inputs (say A and B) and print the result of the following operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction 
3. Multiplication

Output:

The first line should contain the sum of the two given integers.
The second line should contain the subtraction of the two given integers.
The third line should contain the product of the two given integers.

Explanation:

In the given example, the inputs are A = 4 and B = 3
Addition: 4 + 3 = 7
Subtraction: 4 - 3 = 1
Multiplication: 4 * 3 =  12

Sample Input 1:

4
3

Sample Output 1:

7
1
12

Sample Input 2:

2
5

Sample Ouput 2:

7
-3
10

Solution:

a=int(input())
b=int(input())

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)

03. ﻿Percentage - 2

Write a program that reads a number NN is divided into two parts X and Y
• X is 30 percent of N.
• Y is the remaining percentage of N. Print Y.

Note:

Total Percentage of X and Y is 100.
The Percentage (P) of Number (N) can be calculated as:
value = (percentage / 100)* number

Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the Y percentage of N.

Explanation:﻿

For example, if the given number is N = 50,
• Total Percentage of X and Y is 100.
• X is 30 percent of N.
• Y is the remaining percentage of N. The remaining percentage is 70 (100 - 30 ).
• The 70 percent of 50 is,

Y = (percentage / 100)* number
Y = (70 / 100) * 50
Y = 0.7 * 50
Y = 35.0

The output should be 35.0.

Sample Input 1:

50

Sample Output 1:

35.0

Sample Input 2:

200

Sample Ouput 2:

140.0

Solution:

a=int(input())
print((70/100)*a)

04. Area and Perimeter of Square

You are given a side of a square as input. Write a program to find the perimeter and area of the square.

Input:

The input is an integer representing the length of the side of the square.

Output:

The first line of the output should contain area of the square, and 
the second line of the output should contain the perimeter of the square as per the format shown in the sample output. 

Explanation:

Given the length of the side is 2.
As the area of square is Side * Side and the perimeter of the square is $ * Side

Then output should be

Area of the square is: 4
Perimeter of the square

Sample Input 1:

3

Sample Output 1:

Area of the square is: 9
Perimeter of the square is: 12

Sample Input 2:

4

Sample Ouput 2:

Area of the square is: 16
Perimeter of the square is: 16

Solution:

a=input()
a=int(a)
print("Area of the square is: " +str(a*a))
print("Perimeter of the square is: " +str(4*a))

05.﻿ Star Repetition - 5

Write a program that reads two words W1 and W2. W1 contains two parts. The first part contains W2 and 
the second part contains the remaining letters in W1. Print W1 with the first part as stars ( * ).

Input:

The first line of input contains a string representing W1. 
The second line of input contains a string representing W2.
﻿
Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string W1 with the first part as stars.

Explanation:

For example, if the given words are W1 = Subway and W2 Sub.

S u b w a y
0 1 2 3 4 5

• The first of Subway (W1 ) is Sub (W2 ).
• Print stars (*) instead of Sub in Subway.

The Ouput should be ***way

Sample Input 1:

Subway
Sub

Sample Output 1:

***way

Sample Input 2:

Hyperactive
Hyper

Sample Ouput 2:

*****active

Solution:

a=input()
b=input()
print("*"*len(b)+a[len(b):])

06.﻿ Part of a String - 3

Write a program that reads a string A and prints the string A by excluding the first two and last 
two characters of the string.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the string obtained by excluding the first two 
and last two characters of the string A.
﻿
Explanation:

For example, if the given string is ##Soft##,
Exclude the first two and last two characters of a string ##Soft##.

# # S o f t # #
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

The output should be Soft as the first two and last two characters are excluded.

Sample Input 1:

##Soft##

Sample Output 1:

07. Replace a Letter

Write a program that reads a word W, an index I, and a letter C.
Print the word W by replacing the letter at the index | with the given letter C.

Input:

The first line of input contains a string. 
The second line of input contains an integer.
The third line of input contains a string.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string obtained by replacing the letter at the index 
of the word W with the letter C.

Constraints:

The index is always greater than 0 and one less than word length (length-1).

Explanation:

For example, if the given word W is Prime, the index is 3 and the letter C is z.

P r i m e
0 1 2 3 4

• The letters before the 3rd index are Pri.
• The letter at the 3rd index m should be replaced with Z.
• The letter after the 3rd index is e.
The output should be Prize as the letter m in Prime is replaced with the letter Z.

Sample Input 1:

Prime
3
z

Sample Output 1:

Prize

Sample Input 2:

butter
