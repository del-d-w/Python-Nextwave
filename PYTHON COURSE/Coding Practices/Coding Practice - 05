01. Greater than 30 and 50

Write a program that reads a number X and checks,
• If X is greater than 30.
• If X is greater than 30, check if X is also greater than 50.
Print X is greater than 30 if X is greater than 30.
Print X is greater than 30 and X is greater than 50 on each line if X is greater than 50.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing X.

﻿Output
If X is greater than 30,

The output should be a single line containing the string X is Greater than 30.

If X is greater than 30 and if X is also greater than 50,

The first line of output should be a string containing X is Greater than 30. 
The second line of output should be a string containing X is Greater than 50.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is X = 45,
✓ X is greater than 30. (45 is greater than 30) 
X  X is greater than 50. (45 is not greater than 50)
The output should be X is Greater than 30.

For example, if the given number is X = 99
✓ X is greater than 30. (99 is greater than 30)
✓ X is greater than 50. (99 is greater than 50)
The output should be,

X is Greater than 30
X is Greater than 50

Sample Input 1:

45

Sample Output 1:

X is Greater than 30

Sample Input 2:

99

Sample Output 2:

X is Greater than 30
X is Greater than 50

Solution

number  = int(input())

is_number_greater_than_30 = number > 30
is_number_greater_than_50 = number > 50

if is_number_greater_than_30:
    print("X is Greater than 30")

    if is_number_greater_than_50:
        print("X is Greater than 50")

"""
x=int(input())
if x>30 and x>50:
    print("X is Greater than 30")
    print("X is Greater than 50")
elif x>30:
    print("X is Greater than 30")

02. Rankers

Write a program that reads the rank R of a student and checks,
• If R is less than or equal to 3.
• If R is not less than or equal to 3, check if R is less than or equal to 10.
Print One of Top 3 if the R is less than or equal to 3.
Print Not Top 3 but One of Top 10 if R is less than or equal to 10 but not less than or equal to 3.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing R.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string. One of Top 3 should be printed if R is
less than or equal to 3. Not Top 3 but One of Top 10 should be printed if R is less than or equal
to 10 but not less than or equal to 3.

Explanation﻿
For example, if the given rank is R = 7,
X R is less than or equal to 3. (7 is not less than or equal to 3)
✓ R is less than or equal to 10. (7 is less than or equal to 10)
The output should be Not Top 3 but One of Top 10 as 7 is less than or equal to 10 but not less than or equal to 3.

Sample Input 1:

7

Sample Output 1:

Not Top 3 but One of Top 10

Sample Input 2:

3

Sample Output 2:

One of Top 3

Solution

rank = int(input())

is_less_than_or_equal_10 = rank <= 10
is_less_than_or_equal_3 = rank <= 3

if is_less_than_or_equal_10:
    if is_less_than_or_equal_3:
        print("One of Top 3")
    else:
        print("Not Top 3 but One of Top 10")

"""
a=int(input())
if a<=3:
    print("One of Top 3")
elif a<=10:
    print("Not Top 3 but One of Top 10")

03. Weight

Write a program that reads the weight W of a box in kg and checks,
• If W is greater than or equal to 100.
• If W is not greater than or equal to 100, check if W is greater than or equal to 30.
Print Box is Heavier if W is greater than or equal to 100.
Print Box is Heavy if W is not greater than or equal to 100 but greater than or equal to 30.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing W.

﻿Output
The output should be a single line containing a string. Box is Heavier should be printed if W is greater
than or equal to 100. Box is Heavy should be printed if W is not greater than or equal to 100 but greater 
than or equal to 30.

Explanation
For example, if the given weight of the box is W = 60,
x W is greater than or equal to 100. (60 is not greater than or equal to 100)
✓ W is greater than or equal to 30. (60 is greater than or equal to 30)
The output should be Box is Heavy as 60 is not greater than or equal to 100 but greater than or equal to 30.

Sample Input 1:

60

Sample Output 1:

Box is Heavy

Sample Input 2:

150

Sample Output 2:

Box is Heavier

Solution

weight = int(input())

is_heavy = weight >= 30
is_heavier = weight >= 100

if is_heavier:
    print("Box is Heavier")
else:
    if is_heavy:
        print("Box is Heavy")

"""
a=int(input())
if a>=100:
    print("Box is Heavier")
elif a>=30:
    print("Box is Heavy")

04. Allowed to Exam

Write a program that reads two strings H and I and checks,
• If H is equal to "Y".
• If H is not equal to "Y", check if I is equal to "Y".
Print Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket if H is equal to "Y".
Print Allowed to Exam - Has Identification Card if H is not equal to "Y" and I is equal to "Y".

Input
The first line of input contains a string representing H
The second line of input contains a string representing I.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string. Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket should 
be printed if H is equal to "Y". 
Allowed to Exam - Has Identification Card should be printed if H is not equal to "Y" and I is equal to "Y".

Explanation
For example, if the given strings are H = Y and |=N,
✓ His equal to "Y". ("Y" is equal to "Y")
X H is not equal to "Y" and I is equal to "Y".
The output should be Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket as H is equal to "Y".

Sample Input 1:

Y
N

Sample Output 1:

Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket

Solution

hall_ticket = input()
identification = input()

has_hall_ticket = (hall_ticket == "Y")
has_identification = (identification == "Y")

if has_hall_ticket:
    print("Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket")
else:
    if has_identification:
        print("Allowed to Exam - Has Identification Card")

"""
h=input()
i=input()
if h=="Y":
    print("Allowed to Exam - Has Hall ticket")
elif i=="Y":
    print("Allowed to Exam - Has Identification Card")
