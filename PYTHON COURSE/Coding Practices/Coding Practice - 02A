is greater than 70, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 86, the output should be True as 86 is greater than 70.

Sample Input 1:

86

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

45

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

number = input()
number = int(number)
result = number > 70
print(result)

02. Greatest among two numbers

Write a program that reads two numbers and checks if the first number is greater than the second number.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer.
The second line of input contains an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the first number is greater 
than the second number, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are 6 and 4, the output should be True as 6 is greater than 4.

Sample Input 1:

6
4

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

13
17

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_number = input()
first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = input()
second_number = int(second_number)

result = first_number > second_number
print(result)

03. Negative Number

Write a program that reads a number and checks if the given number is a negative number.

Note: Negative numbers are numbers that are less than zero.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the given number is a 
negative number, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is -25, the output should be True as -25 is less than zero.

Sample Input 1:

-25

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

3

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

number = input()
number = int(number)
result = number < 0
print(result)

04. Equal To

Write a program that reads two words and checks if the given two words are the same.

Input
The first line of input contains a string.
The second line of input contains a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the given two words are 
the same, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given words are Jam and Jam,
The output should be True as both the words Jam and Jam are the same.

Sample Input 1:

Jam
Jam

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

Dog
Cow

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_word = input()
second_word = input()
result = first_word == second_word
print(result)

05. Sunday

Write a program that reads a day number and checks if the given day is a Sunday.

Day           Day Number

Monday            1
Tuesday           2
Wednesday         3
Thursday          4
Friday            5
Saturday          6
Sunday            7

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the given day is Sunday, 
otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example,
• if the given day number is 7, the output should be True as 7 is equal to the day number of Sunday which is 7.
• if the given day number is 4, the output should be False as 4 is not equal to the day number of Sunday which is 7.

Sample Input 1:

7

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

1

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

day_number = input()
day_number = int(day_number)
result = day_number == 7
print(result)

06. Not Equal To

Write a program that reads two numbers and checks if the given two numbers are not the same.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer.
The second line of input contains an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the given two numbers are
not the same, otherwise False should be printed. 

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are 2 and 3, the output should be True as 2 is not equal to 3.

Sample Input 1:

2
3

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

10
10

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_number = int(input())
second_number = int(input())
result = first_number != second_number
print(result)

07. Greater than or Equal to

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks if A is greater than or equal to B. 
Print the result as shown in the sample output.

Input
The first line of input contains a float.
The second line of input contains a float.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string as shown in the sample output.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = 4.3 and B = 3.2,
• A is greater than or equal to B: True. (4.3 is greater than or equal to 3.2)
• Add the string "A >= B is " before True.
The output should be A >= B is True.

Sample Input 1:

4.3
3.2

Sample Output 1:

A >= B is True

Sample Input 2:

9.9
10.0

Sample Output 2:

A >= B is False

Solution

a = input()
a = float(a)
b = input()
b = float(b)
result = a >= b
result = str(result)
print("A >= B is " + result)

08. Less than or Equal to

Write a program that reads two numbers and checks if the first number is less than or equal to the second number.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer.
The second line of input contains a float.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the first number is less 
than or equal to the second number, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are 2 and 5.3, the output should be True as 2 is less than 5.3

Sample Input 1:

2
5.3

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

13
10.3

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_number = input()
first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = input()
second_number = float(second_number)
result = first_number <= second_number
print(result)
