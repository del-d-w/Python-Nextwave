01. Positive or Negative

﻿Write a program that reads a number N and checks if the number N is a Negative Number or a Positive Number.
Print Positive if N is greater than O.
Print Negative if N is less than 0.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a float representing N.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. Positive should be printed if N is greater than O. 
Negative should be printed if N is less than 0.

Constraints:

﻿The given number N is not equal to 0.

Explanation:

For example, if the given number is N = -12.5,
• -12.5 is less than zero ( -12.5 <0).
The output should be Negative.

For example, if the given number is N = 15.2,
• 15.2 is greater than zero (15.2 > 0 ).
The output should be Positive.

Sample Input 1:

-12.5

Sample Output 1:

Negative

Sample Input 2:

15.2 

Sample Output 2:

Positive

Solution:

rank=input()
rank=float(rank)
if rank<0:
  print("Negative")  
else:
 print("Positive")

02. Profit or Loss

Write a program that reads the Cost Price CP and Selling Price SP of a product and compares SP with CP.
Print Profit if SP is greater than CP
Print Loss if SP is less than CP
Print No Profit - No Loss if SP is equal to CP .

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing CP The second line of input contains an integer representing SP.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. Profit should be
printed if SP is greater than CP. Loss should be printed if SP is
less than CP. No Profit - No Loss should be printed if SP is equal to CP.

Explanation:

For example, if the given Cost Price is CP = 143 and the given Selling Price is SP = 155,
• The Selling Price SP is greater than the Cost Price CP .(155 is greater than 143)
The output should be Profit.

Sample Input 1:

143
155

Sample Output 1:

Profit

Sample Input 2:

165
125

Sample Output 2:

Loss

Solution:

cp=int(input())
sp=int(input())
if(sp>cp):
    print("Profit")
elif(sp<cp):
    print("Loss")
else:
    (sp==cp)
    print("No Profit - No Loss")

03. Get Season
﻿
Write a program to find season for the given month number.

Input:

The first line of input will contain an integer that indicates the number of the month.
If the given number of the month is 3, that indicates March month.

Output:

If the given month is either November or December or January, print "Winter".
If the given month is either February or March, print "Spring".
If the given month is either April or May or June print "Summer".
If the given month is either July or August, print "Rainy".
If the given month is either September or October, print "Autumn".

Explanation:

For example, if the given month is 1, which indicates January month, the output should be "Winter".
Similarly, if the given month is 4, which indicates April month, the output should be "Summer".

Sample Input 1:

1

Sample Output 1:

Winter

Sample Input 2:

4

Sample Output 2:

Summer

Solution:

a=int(input())
if(a==2 or a==3):
    print("Spring")
elif(a==4 or a==5 or a==6):
    print("Summer")
elif(a==7 or a==8):
    print("Rainy")
elif (a==9 or a==10):
    print("Autumn")
else:
    (a==11 or a==12 or a==1)
    print("Winter")

04. Smallest Among 3 Numbers
﻿
Write a program to print the smallest value among the three numbers A, B, and C.

Input:

The first line is an integer A. The second line is an integer B. The third line is an integer C.

Explanation:

In the given values A = 6, B5, C=4. 4 is the smallest value among the three.
So the output should be 4.

Sample Input 1:

6
5
4

Sample Output 1:

4

Sample Input 2:

-10000
-10000
-10000

Sample Output 2:

-10000

Solution:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if a < b and a < c :
    smallest = a
elif b < c :
    smallest = b
else :
    smallest = c
print(smallest)

05. Weather Condition

Write a program to dipslay a customized message based on temperature T.

Input:

The first line is areal number T
﻿
Output:

Print Freezing weather if T < 0
Print Very Cold weather if 0 <= T < 10
Print Cold weather if 10 <= T < 20
Print Normal if 20 <= T < 30
Print Hot if 30 <T< 40
Print Very Hot if T >= 40.

Explanation:

In the given example, the temperature is -50.0.
As the temperature is less than 0, the output should be Freezing weather

Sample Input 1:

-50.0

Sample Output 1:

Freezing weather

Sample Input 2:

5.7

Sample Output 2:

Very Cold weather

Solution:

t=float(input())
if(t<0):
    print("Freezing weather")
elif(0<=t<10):
    print("Very Cold weather")
elif(10<=t<20):
    print("Cold weather")
elif(20<=t<30):
    print("Normal")
elif(30<=t<40):
    print("Hot")
else:
    (t>=40)
    print("Very Hot")

06. Leap Year
﻿
Write a program that reads a year Y and checks if the year Y is a leap year. 
A year is a leap year if any of the given conditions are satisfied.

Y is divisible by 400.
Y is divisible by 4, and not divisible by 100.

Print True if any of the given conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, print False.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer representing Y

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a boolean value. True should be printed 
if any of the given conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, False should be printed.

﻿Explanation:

For example, if the given Y = 2016,
X Y is divisible by 400. (The remainder is 16 when 2016 is divided by 400)
✓ Y is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100. (The remainder is O when 2016 is divided by 4 and the
remainder is 16 when 2016 is divided by 100)
As one of the given conditions is satisfied,
The output should be True.

﻿For example, if the given Y = 1800,
X Y is divisible by 400. (The remainder is 200 when 1800 is divided by 400)
X Y is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100. (The remainder is O when 1800 is divided by 4 and the
remainder is O when 1800 is divided by 100)
As both the given conditions are not satisfied,
The output should be False.

Sample Input 1:

2016

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

1800

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution:

a=int(input())
if (a % 400 == 0) and (a % 100 == 0):
    print("True")
elif (a % 4 ==0) and (a % 100 != 0):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
