01. Return the Given Argument

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a function. Write a program to return the value passed to the function.

Input:
The first line of input will contain an integer.

Ouput:
The output should be a single line containing the value returned by the function.

Explanation:

For example, if the given integer is 20, the output should be 20, as the function returns the same value.

Question: Return the Given Argument
In this problem, you are given a function. Your task is to write a program that returns the value passed to the function.

Input:

The first line of input will contain an integer.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the value returned by the function.

Example:

For example, if the given integer is 20, the output should be 20, as the function returns the same value.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Define the function that takes an argument and returns the same value.
Read the input value (an integer) from the user.
Call the function with the input value and print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Define the Function
First, let's define the function func that takes one argument arg_1 and returns the same value.

Step 2: Read the Input
Now, we need to read the input value representing the integer. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 3: Call the Function and Print the Result
Finally, we will call the function func with the input value n and store the result in a variable called result. Then, we will print the result.

Sample Input 1:

20

Sample Output 1:

20

Sample Input 2:

5

Sample Output 2:

5

Solution:

def func(arg_1):
    return arg_1

n = int(input())
result = func(n)
print(result)
