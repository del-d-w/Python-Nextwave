01.﻿Compare Digits

Write a program that reads a two-digit number N and checks,

• If the number N is greater than 25.
• If the first digit of N is greater than the second digit of N.

Print the result as shown in sample output.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a two-digit integer.

Output:
﻿
• The first line of output should be a boolean. True should be printed if the number is greater than 25,
otherwise False should be printed.
The second line of output should be a boolean. True should be printed if the first digit is greater than
the second digit, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given two-digit number is N = 28,
✓ N is greater than 25.
X The first digit of N is greater than the second digit of N. (first digit of N is 2 and 
the second digit of N is 8, 2 is not greater than 8)

The output should be

True
False

Sample Input 1:

28

Sample Ouput 1:

True
False

Sample Input 2:

87

Sample Ouput 2:

True
True

Solution:

a=int(input())
b=str(a)
if (a>25)==False:
    print("False")
if (a>25)==True:
    print("True")
if (int(b[0])>int(b[1]))==False:
    print("False")
if (int(b[0])>int(b[1]))==True:
    print("True")

02. ﻿Compare First Digit & Last Digit

Write a program that reads two three-digit numbers A and B and checks if the first digit of A 
is less than the last digit of B.

Input
The first line of input contains a three-digit integer representing A.
The second line of input contains a three-digit integer representing B.
﻿
Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the first digit
of A is less than the last digit of B, otherwise False should be printed.

04.﻿ Percentage - 3

Write a program that reads a percentage P and a number N and checks if the P percentage of 500 is equal to the number N.

Note
The Percentage (P) of 500 can be calculated as:
value = (percentage / 100) * 500
﻿
Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing P. The second line of input contains an integer representing N.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the P percentage of 500
is equal to the number N, otherwise False should be printed.
﻿
Explanation
For example, if the given percentage is P = 50 and number N = 250, the 50 percentage of 500 is,
value = (percentage / 100) * 500
value = (50 / 100) * 500
value = 0.5 * 500
value = 250.0
