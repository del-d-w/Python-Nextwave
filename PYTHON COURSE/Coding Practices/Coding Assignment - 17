01. ﻿Print Characters - 4

Given a string S and two numbers M and N, write a program to print the characters of S that
have Unicode values from M to N separated by a space.

Note:

Unicode values are unique numbers that are given to every character, symbol and digit.

Input:

The first line of input contains a string representing S The second line of input contains an integer 
representing M. The third line of input contains an integer representing N.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string that has characters that have Unicode values 
from M to N separated by a space.

Explanation:

﻿For example, if the given string is S = "words", and two numbers are M = 99 and N = 112.
Character  Unicode value
    W          119
    o          111
    r          114
    d          100
    s          115

• The characters o and d have Unicode values from 99 to 112.
The output should be "o d".

Sample Input 1:

words
99
112

Sample Output 1:

o d

Sample Input 2:

AiRPort
65
111

Sample Output 2:

A i R P o 

Solution:

s=input()
m=int(input())
n=int(input())
res=[]
a=''
for i in range(m,n+1):
    res.append(i)
for i in s:
    if ord(i) in res:
        a+=i+' '
print(a)

02. ﻿Unicode Value of First Digit

Given a string S, write a program to print the Unicode value of the first digit in the given string.

Note:

Unicode values are unique numbers that are given to every character, symbol and digit.

Input:
﻿
The input will be a single line containing a string representing S

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the Unicode value of the first digit in the given string.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is S = "python5834"
The first digit in python5834 is 5.
The Unicode value of 5 is 53.

The output should be 53.

Sample Input 1:

python5834

Sample Output 1:

53

Sample Input 2:

0Chair12

Sample Output 2:

48 

Solution:

s=input()
for i in s:
    if i.isdigit():
        print(ord(i))
        break

03. Replacing Characters of Sentence

You are given a string S. Write a program to replace each letter of the string with the next letter 
that comes in the English alphabet.

Note: Ensure that while replacing the letters, uppercase should be replaced with uppercase letters,
and lowercase should be replaced with lowercase letters.

Input:

The first line of input is a string.

Explanation:

In the given example, Hello World.
If we replace each letter with the letter that comes next in the English alphabet, H becomes, e becomes f and so on
So, the output should be Ifmmp Xpsme.

Sample Input 1:

Hello World

Sample Output 1:

Ifmmp Xpsme

Sample Input 2:

Something is better than Nothing

Sample Output 2:

Tpnfuijoh jt cfuufs uibo Opuijoh

Solution:

a=input()
b=""
for i in a:
    i=ord(i)+1
    b=b+chr(i)
    b=b.replace("!"," ")
print(b)

04. ﻿Replace First Letter in Words

Given a sentence S, write a program to print the sentence by replacing the first letter of every
word with its next letter based on its Unicode value.

Note:

Unicode values are unique numbers that are given to every character, symbol and digit.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a string representing S.

﻿
Explanation:

For example, if the given sentence is S = "East And West",
The sentence "East And West" has three words.
• The first letter of the word East is E.
  • The Unicode value of E is 69.
  • The letter with the next Unicode value 70 is F.
  • Replace E with F.
• The first letter of the word And is A.
  • The Unicode value of A is 65.
  • The letter with the next Unicode value 66 is B.
  • Replace A with B.
• The first letter of the word West is W.
  • The Unicode value of W is 87.
  • The letter with the next Unicode value 88 is X.
  • Replace W with X.
The output should be "Fast Bnd Xest".

Sample Input 1:

East And West

Sample Output 1:

Fast Bnd Xest 

Sample Input 2:

NEver In a MiLLion YeARs

Sample Output 2:

OEver Jn b NiLLion ZeARs

Solution:

s=input().split(' ')
a=''
for i in s:
    if i[0].isalpha():
        s=chr(ord(i[0])+1)+i[1:]
        a+=s+' '
    else:
        a+=i+' '
print(a)

05. ﻿Print Characters in Dictionary Order

Given a string S, write a program that prints the character with the Least Unicode Value and the 
character with the Highest Unicode Value separated by a space.

Note:

Unicode values are unique numbers that are given to every character, symbol and digit.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a string representing S .

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string that has the character with the Least Unicode 
Value and the character with the Highest Unicode Value separated by a space.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is S = "Five",
Character  Unicode value
    F          70
    i          105
    V          118
    e          101

• The character with the Least Unicode Value is F and the
character with the Highest Unicode Value is v.
The output should be "F v".

Sample Input 1:

Five

Sample Output 1:

F v

Sample Input 2:

TeamWork

Sample Output 2:

T r

Solution:

s=input()
res=[]
p=''
for i in s:
    res.append(ord(i))
m=max(res)
n=min(res)
for i in s:
    if ord(i)==n:
        p+=i
for i in s:
    if ord(i)==m:
        p+=i
#print(p)
a=[]
for i in p:
    if i not in a:
        a.append(i)
print(' '.join(a))
