For example, if the given word is Software, the number of characters in the word is 8
The output should be 8

Sample Input 1:

Software

Sample Output 1:

8

Sample Input 2:

Champion

Sample Ouput 2:

8

Solution:

message = input()
length = len(message)
print(length)

02. Star Repetition

Write a program that reads a word and prints stars (*) equal to the length of the word.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing stars (*) equal to the length of the word.

Explanation
Print two stars on the first line and two stars on the second line.

Sample Input 1:

qwerty

Sample Ouput 1:

******

Sample Input 2:

John1234

Sample Ouput 2:

********

Solution:

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
result = "*" * word_length
print(result)

03. Subtract 1 from String Length

Write a program that reads a word and prints L - 1 where L is the length of the word.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer obtained after subtracting 1 from the length of the word.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Ice, the output should be 2 as the length of the word is 3.

Sample Input 1:

Ice

Sample Ouput 1:

2

Sample Input 2:

Area

Sample Ouput 2:

3

Solution:

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
result = word_length - 1
print(result)

04. Index of Last Character

Write a program that reads a word and prints the index of the last character of the word.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer which is the index of the last character of the word.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Python, the output should be 5 as the index starts from 0 and the index 
of the last character is 5.

P y t h o n
0 1 2 3 4 5


Sample Input 1:

Python

Sample Ouput 1:

5

Sample Input 2:

John123

Sample Ouput 2:

6

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
last_index = word_length - 1
print(last_index)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

05. Last Character

Write a program which prints the last character of a given word.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a word.

Output
The output should be a single line containing the last character of the given word.

Explanation
For example, if the given input word is "January", your code should print the last character "y".

Sample Input 1:

January

Sample Ouput 1:

y

Sample Input 2:

Classroom

Sample Ouput 2:

m

Solution:

word = input()
length_of_the_word = len(word)
last_index = length_of_the_word - 1
character_at_last_index = word[last_index]
print(character_at_last_index)

06. Length Excluding Characters

Write a program that reads a word and prints the length of the word excluding the first and last character.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the length of the word excluding the first and last character.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Blockchain,
• The number of characters in the word is 10
• The first and the last characters should be removed, i.e. two characters should be removed from the word
The output should be 8, as 10 - 2 is 8.

Sample Input 1:

Blockchain

Sample Output 1:

8

Sample Input 2:

Cyber Security

Sample Ouput 2:

12

Solution:

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
word_length_excluding_chars = word_length - 2
print(word_length_excluding_chars)

07. Star Repetition - 2

Write a program that reads a word and prints the first letter of the given word and stars (*) instead of the other letters.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

output
The output should be a single line containing the first letter of the given word and stars (*) instead of the other letters.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Queue,
• The number of letters in the word Queue is 5. We have to print the first letter Q.
• Now, without the first letter, there are 4 letters. So, we have to print 4 stars (*)
The output should be Q****.

Sample Input 1:

Queue

Sample Output 1:

Q****

Sample Input 2:

Password

Sample Ouput 2:

P*******

Solution:

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
first_character = word[0]
number_of_stars = word_length - 1
result = first_character + ("*" * number_of_stars)
print(result)

08. Half Length of String

Write a program that reads a word and prints half the length of the word.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a string.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a float that is half the length of the word.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Airplane,
• Length of the word is 8
• Half of the length of the word is 8/2 = 4.0
So, the output should be 4.0.

Sample Input 1:

Airplane

Sample Output 1:

4.0

Sample Input 2:

Zebra

Sample Ouput 2:

2.5

Solution:

word = input()
word_length = len(word)
half_word_length = word_length/2
print(half_word_length)
