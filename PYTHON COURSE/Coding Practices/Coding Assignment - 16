01.﻿ Kth Largest Factor - 2

Given two numbers N and K, write a program to print the Kth largest factor of the number N.

Note:

A Factor of a number is a positive integer that divides the number exactly, leaving no remainder.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing N. The second line of input contains an integer
representing K.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the Kth largest factor of N. Print 1 
if the number of factors of N is less than K.

Explanation:

﻿For example, if the given numbers are N = 12 and K = 3,
• The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.
• The 3rd largest factor of 12 is 4.
The output should be 4.

02. First Prime Number

Given a number N, write a program to read N inputs and print the first Prime number among the given N inputs.

Note:

A Prime Number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no factors other than 1 and itself.
﻿
Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing N.
The next N lines of input contain integers.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the
first Prime number among the given N inputs.

03. ﻿Multiple of 5

Given a number N, write a program to read N inputs and print the given numbers until you encounter
a multiple of 5, each on a new line.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing N. The next N lines of input contain integers.

Output:
