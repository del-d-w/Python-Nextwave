01. Increment the Number

Write a program that reads a number N and checks if N is greater than 10.
Print the result of N+5 if N is greater than 10. Otherwise, print the result of N + 1.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer. The result of N +5 should be printed if
N is greater than 10. Otherwise, the result of N + 1 should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is N = 3,
• 3 is not greater than 10.
• The result of N + 1 is 4 ( 3 + 1 = 4 ).
The output should be 4 as N is not greater than 10.

For example, if the given number is N = 63
• 63 is greater than 10.
• The result of N + 5 is 68 ( 63 + 5 = 68 ).
The output should be 68 as N is greater than 10.

13. Valid Traingle

Given three angles of a triangle, write a program to check whether the triangle is valid or not.

Input
The first line of input will contain the first angle of the triangle.

The third line of input will contain the third angle of the triangle.

Output
If the sum of the three angles is equal to 180, print "It's a Triangle". In all other cases, print "It's not a Triangle".

Explanation
For example, if the first angle is 80, the second angle is 90, and the third angle is 100.
Therefore the sum of the three angles(80 + 90 + 100) is 270, which is not equal to 180. 
So the output should be "It's not a Triangle".

Similarly, if the first angle is 60, the second angle is 60, and the third angle is 60. 
Therefore the sum of the three angles(60 + 60 + 60) is 180, which is equal to 180.
