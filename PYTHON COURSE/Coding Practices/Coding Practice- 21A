Divisible by Seven - 2

In this tutorial, we will learn how to write a simple Python program to check if a given number is divisible by 7. Let's break down the solution 
into smaller steps and explain each step.

Step 1: Understand the problem
We have a number 'N', and our task is to check if it is divisible by 7. If it is, we need to print "True", otherwise, we print "False".

Step 2: Write the function
We will start by writing a function called divisible_by_seven. This function will take one input, the number we want to check, 
and print "True" or "False" based on whether it is divisible by 7.

Step 3: Calculate the remainder
Next, we need to find the remainder when our number is divided by 7. We will use the modulo operator (%) for this. If the remainder is 0, 
it means the number is divisible by 7.

Step 4: Check if the remainder is 0
Now, we will use an 'if' statement to check if the remainder is 0. If it is, we set the result to "True". Otherwise, we set it to "False".

Step 5: Print the result
Finally, we will print the result ("True" or "False").
Our divisible_by_seven function is now complete. It should look like this:

Step 6: Get the input and call the function
Now, we need to get the input from the user and call our divisible_by_seven function with that input. We will use the input() function to get
the user's input and convert it to an integer using the int() function.

Now, you should be able to understand and write a Python program that checks if a given number is divisible by 7.

Sample Input 1:

14

        result = True
    else:
        result = False
    print(result)
    
n = int(input())

06. Discount - 2

Write a function with the name get_discount that takes the bill amount as an argument.

 - If the bill amount is less than 500, the discount should be "5%".
 - If the bill amount is greater than or equal to 500 and less than 2500, the discount should be "10%".
 - If the bill amount is greater than or equal to 2500, the discount should be "20%".

Input:
The input will be a single line containing a positive integer.

Ouput:
The output should be a single line containing the discount according to the above conditions.

Explanation:
For example, if the given bill amount is 1500, the output should be "10%", as it is greater than 500 and less than 2500
For example, if the given bill amount is 250, the output should be "5%", as it is less than 500

Tutorial: Discount Calculation in Python
In this tutorial, we will learn how to solve the "Discount - 2" coding question using Python step by step. 

Step 1: Define the function
First, we need to create a function named get_discount. This function will take one input: the bill amount. We will use this input to determine the discount percentage.

Step 2: Check the bill amount
Now, we will check the bill amount to determine the discount percentage. We will use if, elif, and else statements to cover all the possible cases.

If the bill amount is less than 500, the discount is 5%.
If the bill amount is greater than or equal to 500 and less than 2500, the discount is 10%.
If the bill amount is greater than or equal to 2500, the discount is 20%.

Step 3: Return the discount
Once we have determined the discount percentage, we will return it from our function.

Step 4: Get the bill amount from the user
We will now ask the user to enter the bill amount. We will use the input() function to get the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 5: Call the function and print the result
Finally, we will call our get_discount function with the user's bill amount and store the result in a variable named result. We will then print the result to the screen.

Sample Input 1:

1500

Sample Output 1:

10%

Sample Input 2:

250

Sample Output 2:

5%

Solution:

def get_discount(amount):
    if amount < 500:
        discount = "5%"
    elif (amount >= 500) and (amount < 2500):
        discount = "10%"
    else:
        discount = "20%"
    return discount

amount = int(input())
result = get_discount(amount)
print(result)

07. Print N Integers - 3

A function is given in the prefilled code that takes a number N as an argument.
Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to the given number N, each on a new line.

Input:
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output:
The output should be N lines containing integers from 1 to the given number N that is passed as an argument to the function, each on a new line.

Explanation:
For example, if the given number N=4,
• The numbers from 1 to 4 are 1, 2, 3 and 4
The output should be
1
2
3
4

Tutorial: Print N Integers - 3
Step 1: Create a function to print the numbers
First, let's create a function called print_numbers that takes a single argument, number. This function will be responsible for printing the numbers from 1 to N.

Step 2: Use a loop to print each number
Inside the print_numbers function, we will use a for loop to go through each number from 1 to N. We can do this by using the range function. The range 
function generates a list of numbers from a starting value to an ending value. In this case, we want to start at 1 and end at N.

Since the range function stops before the ending value, we need to add 1 to N, like this: range(1, number + 1). Inside the loop, we just need to print the current number.

Step 3: Get the input from the user
Now that we have our function ready, we need to get the input from the user. The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N. 
We can use the input() function to get the input from the user and the int() function to convert the input to an integer.

Step 4: Call the function with the user's input
Finally, we need to call the print_numbers function with the user's input as the argument. This will execute the function and print the numbers from 1 to N.

Sample Input 1:

1

Sample Output 1:

1
2
3
4

Sample Input 2:

10

Sample Output 2:

1
2
3

Solution:

def print_numbers(number):
    for each_number in range(1, number + 1):
        print(each_number)

number = int(input())
print_numbers(number)

Step 2: Use a loop to iterate through the numbers
Step 3: Check if the number is even or odd
Step 4: Print the number with its label

Question: Even Numbers or Odd Numbers
Write a function with the name show_numbers that takes a number (N) and print all the numbers from 0 to N with a label to identify the 
even and odd numbers as shown below:

The input will be a single line containing a positive integer. The output should be N+1 lines containing a number with a label in each line.

Approach
Define a function called show_numbers that takes a number as input.
Use a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 0 to N.
Check if the number is even or odd.
Print the number with its label (EVEN or ODD).

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Define the function and read the input
First, we need to define a function called show_numbers that takes a number as input. We also need to read the input value representing the number N. We can use the input() function to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer.

Step 2: Use a loop to iterate through the numbers
Inside the show_numbers function, we need to use a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 0 to N. We can use a for loop with the range() function to achieve this.

Step 3: Check if the number is even or odd
Now, we need to check if the current number i is even or odd. We can do this by using the modulo operator %. If i % 2 is equal to 0, then the number is 
even, otherwise, it is odd.

Step 4: Print the number with its label
Finally, we need to print the number i with its label (EVEN or ODD). We can use the print() function and concatenate the number with its label using the + operator.
