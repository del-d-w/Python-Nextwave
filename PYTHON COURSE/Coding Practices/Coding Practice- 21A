Question: Split the Sentence
Given a sentence S. The words in the sentence S are separated by a space.
Write a program that prints a list containing the words in the sentence.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input sentence.
Split the sentence into words.
Print the list of words.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input sentence
First, we need to read the input sentence from the user. We can use the input() function to read the input and store it in a variable called sentence.

Step 2: Split the sentence into words
Now, we need to split the sentence into words. We can use the split() function to do this. The split() function will break the sentence
into words whenever it finds a space. We will store the list of words in a variable called words_list.

Step 3: Print the list of words
Finally, we need to print the list of words. We can use the print() function to do this.

Sample Input 1:

Knowledge is power

Question: Divisible by 3
In this coding question, you are given a list of space-separated numbers. Your task is to write a program that prints a list containing 
the given numbers that are divisible by 3.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input and split the numbers into a list.
Create an empty list to store the numbers divisible by 3.
Check if each number in the list is divisible by 3, and if it is, add it to the new list.
Print the list of numbers divisible by 3.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
First, we need to read the input, which is a single line containing space-separated integers. We can use the input() function to read the input 
and then use the split() method to split the numbers into a list.

Step 2: Create an empty list for divisible numbers
Next, we need to create an empty list that will store the numbers divisible by 3. We can do this by creating a new list called divisible_by_3_list.

Step 3: Check if each number is divisible by 3
Now, we need to check if each number in the numbers_list is divisible by 3. We can do this by using a for loop to iterate through the list and 
using the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, we add the number to the divisible_by_3_list.

Step 4: Print the list of divisible numbers
Finally, we need to print the list of numbers divisible by 3. We can do this by using the print() function and passing the divisible_by_3_list as an argument.

Sample Input 1:

3 10 9 11 18 20

Sample Output 1:

[3, 9, 18]

Sample Input 2:

300 485 142 1596

Sample Output 2:

[300, 1596]

Solution:

numbers = input()
numbers_list = numbers.split()
divisible_by_3_list = []
for number in numbers_list:
    number = int(number)
    if number % 3 == 0:
        divisible_by_3_list += [number]

Write a program that prints a new string by joining the third letter of each word in the sentence with the comma(,).

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input sentence.
Split the sentence into words.
Find the third letter of each word.
Join the third letters with a comma.
Print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 3: Find the third letter of each word
Next, we need to find the third letter of each word in the string_list. We can use a for loop to iterate through each word in the list. If the length 
of the word is greater than 2, we can get the third letter using the index 2 (since Python uses zero-based indexing). We will store the third letters 
in a new list called result.

Step 4: Join the third letters with a comma
Now that we have the third letters of each word in the result list, we need to join them with a comma. We can use the join() function to do this.
