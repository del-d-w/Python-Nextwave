01. ﻿Same Digits

Write a program that reads a three-digit number and checks if all the digits of the number are the same.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a three-digit integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if all the digits of
the number are the same, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 222,
• The first digit (2) is equal to the second digit (2).
• The second digit (2) is equal to the third digit (2).
The output should be True as all the digits of the number 222 are the same.

Sample Input 1:

222

Sample Ouput 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

989

Sample Ouput 2:

False

Solution:

a=input()
if a[0]==a[1] and a[1]==a[2] and a[2]==a[0]:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

02.﻿ Sum and Product Check - 2

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks if the sum of A and B is negative or the product
of A and B is negative.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A. The second line of input contains an integer representing B.
﻿
Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the sum of
A and B is negative or the product of A and B is negative, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = 5 and B = -3,
X The sum of A and B is negative. (5+ (-3)= 2, 2 is a positive number)
✓ The product of A and B is negative. (5*(-3)=-15, -15 is a negative number)

The output should be True as the product is negative.

Sample Input 1:

5
-3

Sample Ouput 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

100
4

Sample Ouput 2:

False

Solution:

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if a<0 and b<0 or a*b<0:
    print(True)
else:

03.﻿ Valid Triangle

Write a program that reads three sides A, B, and C of a triangle and checks if the sum of any 
two sides of the triangle is always greater than the third side.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing side A. The second line of input contains
an integer representing side B. The third line of input contains an integer representing side C.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the sum of 
any two sides of the triangle is always greater than the third side, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given sides of the triangle are A = 3, B = 4 and C = 5,
The sum of sides A, B should be greater than C and the sum of sides B C should be greater
than A and the sum of sides C, A should be greater than B.

✓ A + B is greater than C. ( 3+ 4 = 7,7 is greater than 5)
✓ B + C is greater than A. (4 + 5 = 9,9 is greater than 3)
✓ C + A is greater than B. (5 + 3 = 8,8 is greater than 4)

The output should be True as the sum of any two sides of the triangle is always greater than the third side.

first digit of N is equal to 7.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the number N 
is between 50 and 100 or if the first digit of N is equal to 7, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is N = 54,
✓ The number N is between 50 and 100. (54 is between 50 and 100)
X The first digit of N is equal to 7. (The first digit of 54 is 5. 5 is not equal to 7)
The output should be True as N is between 50 and 100.

Sample Input 1:

54

Sample Ouput 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

101

Sample Ouput 2:

False

Solution:

n=input()
if (50<int(n)<100) or (int(n[0])==7):
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

05.﻿ Compare Numbers - 10

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks
if both the below conditions are satisfied.
• One of A and B is less than 20.
• One of A and B is greater than 30.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A The second line of input contains an integer representing B.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if one of A and B
is less than 20 and one of A and B is greater than 30, otherwise False should be printed.
