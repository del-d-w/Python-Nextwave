01. ﻿Product of Numbers divisible by 3 from M to N

Write a program that reads two numbers M and N, and finds the product of the numbers from M to N 
that are divisible by 3.

Print the product of the numbers from M to N that are divisible by 3.
If there are no numbers that are divisible by 3 from M to N. Otherwise, print 1.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing M. 
The second line of input contains an integer representing N.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the product of the numbers from M to N 
that are divisible by 3 if there are numbers that are divisible by 3 from M to N Otherwise, print 1.

Constraints:

N should be greater than or equal to M.

Explanation:

For example, if the given numbers are M = 2 and N = 7,
• The numbers from 2 to 7 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
• Numbers from 2 to 7 that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6.

The product of numbers from 2 to 7 that are divisible by 3 is 18. ( 3*6 = 18 )

03. Count of Numbers divisible by 6 and 8

Write a program that reads a number N and prints the count of numbers from 1 to N that are divisible by both 6 and 8

﻿Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the count of numbers from
1 to N that are divisible by both 6 and 8.

Explanation:

For example, if the given number is N = 50,
Numbers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by both 6 and 8 are 24 and 48.
