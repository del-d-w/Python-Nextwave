01. Greater than Nine

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks if both the given numbers are greater than 9.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A.
The second line of input contains an integer representing B.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if 
both the given numbers are greater than 9, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = 11 and B = 20,
✔ A is greater than 9. (11 is greater than 9)
✓ B is greater than 9. (20 is greater than 9)
The output should be True as both the given numbers are greater than 9.

Sample Input 1:

11
20

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

9
43

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_number = input()
first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = input()
second_number = int(second_number)
result = (first_number > 9) and (second_number > 9)
print(result)

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed
if both the given numbers are negative, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = -1 and B = -2,
✔ A is a negative number. (-1 is less than 0)
✓ B is a negative number. (-2 is less than 0)

04. Not Greater than 100

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B, and checks if the sum of A and B is not greater than 100.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A.
The second line of input contains an integer representing B.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the sum of A and B is not 
greater than 100, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = 30 and B = 20,
• The sum of A and B is 50 (30 + 20 = 50 ).
The output should be True as the sum of A and B is not greater than 100.

Sample Input 1:

30
20

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

60
70

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

number = input()

first_number = input()
first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = input()
second_number = int(second_number)
sum_of_numbers = first_number + second_number
is_greater_than = sum_of_numbers > 100
result = not(is_greater_than)
print(result)

05. Compare Numbers

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B, and checks if both A and B are greater than 35 or A is greater than B.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A.
The second line of input contains an integer representing B.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if both
A and B are greater than 35 or A is greater than B, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are A = 45 and B = 25,
X A and B are greater than 35. (45 is greater than 35 but 25 is less than 35)
✓ A is greater than B. (45 is greater than 25)
The output should be True as A is greater than B.

Sample Input 1:

45
25

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

35
90

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution

first_number = input()
first_number = int(first_number)
second_number = input()
second_number = int(second_number)
are_greater_than = (first_number > 35) and (second_number > 35)
is_first_number_greater = first_number > second_number
result = are_greater_than or is_first_number_greater
print(result)
