01. Sum of the Digits

Write a program that prints the sum of the digits of a given three-digit number.

Input
The input will be a single line containing a three-digit number.

Output
The output should be a single line containing the sum of the three digits of the given number.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 326, the sum of its digits, 3 + 2 + 6 is 11.

Sample Input 1:

326

Sample Output 1:

11

Sample Input 2:

222

Sample Ouput 2:

6

Solution:

word = input()
first_digit = int(word[0])
second_digit = int(word[1])
third_digit = int(word[2])
sum_of_digits = first_digit + second_digit + third_digit
print(sum_of_digits)

02. Indexing

Given a word W and an integer N, write a program to print the character present at the index N in the word W. 

Input
The first line contains the word W 
The second line contains the integer N 

Explanation
For example, when the given word W is Chocolate and the integer N is 2. Since the index starts from zero. 
The character present at index 2 is o.

C h o c o l a t e
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Similarly for Table the character at index 1 is a.

T a b l e
0 1 2 3 4

Constraints
0 <= N < len(W)

Sample Input 1:

Chocolate
2

Sample Ouput 1:

o

Sample Input 2:

Table
1

Sample Ouput 2:

a

Solution:

word = input()
n = input()
n = int(n)
print(word[n])

03. String Repetition - 2

Given a word and a number N, write a program to print the given word, N number of times in a single line.

Input
The first line of input contains a word.
The second line of input contains the integer N which denotes the number of times the word has to be repeated.

Output
The output should contain the given string repeated N times in a single line.
Note: There should not be any spaces between the repetitions.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is "Maths", and the N is 2,the word has to be repeated 2 times, 
so the output should be "MathsMaths"

Sample Input 1:

Maths
2

Sample Ouput 1:

MathsMaths

Sample Input 2:

Hand
6

Sample Ouput 2:

HandHandHandHandHandHand

Solution:

word = input()
n = int(input())
message = word * n
print(message)

04. First Three Characters

Write a program to read a single line of input and print the first three characters in it.

Explanation
For example, if the given input is "Four" the first three characters are "Fou"
Similarly, the first three characters of "Strawberry" are "Str"

Sample Input 1:

Four

Sample Ouput 1:

Fou

Sample Input 2:

Strawberry

Sample Ouput 2:

Str

Solution

message = input()
part = message[:3]
print(part)

05. Part of a String

Write a program that reads a word and an index and prints a part of the word from the given index to the end of the word.

Input
The first line of input contains a string.
The second line of input contains an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string that is the part of the word.

Explanation
For example, if the given word is Unhappy and the index is 2.

U n h a p p y
0 1 2 3 4 5 6

The output should be happy as the slicing starts from the 2nd index and stops at the end of the word.

Sample Input 1:

Unhappy
2

Sample Ouput 1:

happy

Sample Input 2:

goodnight
4

Sample Ouput 2:

night

Solution:

word = input()
start_index = input()
start_index = int(start_index)

part = word[start_index:]
print(part)

06. Part of a String - 2

Write a program that reads a word and two indices (X, Y) and prints a part of the word from the index X to the index Y.

Input
The first line of input contains a string.
The second line of input contains an integer X.
The third line of input contains an integer Y.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string that is part of the word.

Explanation
﻿

For example, if the given word is Growing, index X is 3 and index Y is 6,

G r o w i n g
0 1 2 3 4 5 6

The output should be wing as the slicing starts from the 3rd index and stops at the 6th index.

Sample Input 1:

Growing
3
6

Sample Output 1:

wing

Sample Input 2:

Scrabble
1
5

Sample Ouput 2:

crabb

Solution:

word = input()
start_index = input()
start_index = int(start_index)

end_index = input()
end_index = int(end_index)

part = word[start_index:end_index + 1]
print(part)

07. First N Characters

Write a program that reads a word and a number N and prints the first N characters of the word.

Input
The first line of input contains a string.
The second line of input contains an integer.

output
The output should be a single line containing a string that is the part of the word.

Explanation
﻿

For example, if the given word is Superman and the number N is 5,

S u p e r m a n
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

The output should be Super as the first 5 characters of the word are Super.

Sample Input 1:

Superman
5

Sample Output 1:

Super

Sample Input 2:

impossible
2

Sample Ouput 2:

im

Solution:

word = input()
no_of_characters = input()
no_of_characters = int(no_of_characters)

end_index = no_of_characters
part = word[:end_index]
print(part)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

08. Last N Characters

Write a program that reads a word and a number N and prints the last N characters of the word.

Input
The first line of input contains a string.
The second line of input contains an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a string that is the part of the word.

Explanation
﻿For example, if the given word is Forgive and the number N is 4,

F o r g i v e
0 1 2 3 4 5 6

The output should be give as the last 4 characters of Forgive is give.

Sample Input 1:

Forgive
4

Sample Output 1:

give

Sample Input 2:

hamburger
6

Sample Ouput 2:

burger

Solution:

word = input()
no_of_characters = input()
no_of_characters = int(no_of_characters)

word_length = len(word)
start_index = word_length - no_of_characters

part = word[start_index:]
print(part)
