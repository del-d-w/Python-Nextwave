01. Between 25 and 75

Write a program that reads a number, and checks if the given number is between 25 and 75.

Input
The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if the given number
is between 25 and 75, otherwise False should be printed.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 35,
• The number 35 is greater than 25.
• The number 35 is less than 75.
• So, the number 35 is between 25 and 75.
The output should be True.

Sample Input 1:

35

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

20

Sample Output 2:

False

Sample Input 3:

75

Sample Output 3:

False

Solution

n=int(input())
is_between=((n>25) and (n<75))
print(is_between)
