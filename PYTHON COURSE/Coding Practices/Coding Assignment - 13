01. ﻿Pythagoras Triplets

Given a number N, write a program to print the count of Pythagorean triplets containing numbers A, B and C 
from 1 to N such that the sum of squares of the numbers A and B is equal B < C. to the square of C,
where A < B < C.

A is the first number, B is the second number, and C is the third number in a triplet.

Note:

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three integers A, B, and C such that A2+ B2 = C2
﻿
Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N

Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer which is the count of Pythagorean triplets whose 
sum of squares of numbers A and B is equal to the square of C.

Explanation:

For example, if the given number is N = 20,
The Pythagorean triplets such that A2+ B2 = C2 where A <B < C are,

(3, 4, 5),
(6, 8, 10),
(5, 12, 13),
(9, 12, 15),
(8, 15, 17),
(12, 16, 20)

The count of Pythagorean triplets whose sum of squares of numbers A and B is equal to
the square of C is 6.
The output should be 6.

Sample Input 1:

5

Sample Output 1:

1

Sample Input 2:

20

Sample Ouput 2:

6

Solution:

L=int(input())
count=0
for a in range(1,L-1):
    for b in range(a+1,L):
        for c in range(b+1,L+1):
            x=a*a
            y=b*b
            z=c*c
            if (x+y==z):
                count+=1
print(count)

02. ﻿Numbers in Inverted Right Angled Triangle - 3

Given two numbers S and N, write a program to print an Inverted Right Angled Triangle of N rows K+S -1 and ending with S.

K is the count of numbers that can be printed in N rows of an Inverted Right Angled Triangle.

For example, if the given number is S = 4 and the number of rows is N = 3,

• The count of numbers that can be arranged in an Inverted Right Angled Triangle of 3 rows is K = 6 ( 3+2 + 1 = 6).
• The starting number from which the numbers should be printed is K+S - 1 which is 9 (6 + 4-1).
So, the Inverted Right Angled Triangle should be printed with the numbers starting from 9 (K + S-1) 
and ending with 4 (S) in descending order as given below.

9 8 7
6 5
4

﻿Note:

There is a space after every number.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer representing S.
The second line of input contains an integer representing N.

Output

The output should be N rows containing numbers starting from K+ S-1 and ending with S as an 
Inverted Right Angled Triangle shown in the sample output.

﻿Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are S = 8 and N = 4,
• The count of numbers that can be arranged in an Inverted Right Angled Triangle of 4 rows is K = 10 ( 4+ 3+2+1 = 10).
The starting number from which the numbers should be printed is K+S-1 which is 17 ( 10 + 8-1).
• Print the numbers starting from 17 and ending with 8 (S) in descending order on 4 rows as shown in the given image.

Note:

In the given image, the Number in the box indicates the number and space("17 ")

The Ouput should be 

17 16 15 14
13 12 11
10 9
8

Sample Input 1:

8

Sample Input 2:

2
3

Sample Ouput 2:

7 6 5 
4 3

Solution:

s=int(input())
n=int(input())
k=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    k+=i
num=k+s-1
for i in range(n,0,-1):
    for j in range(i):
        print(num,end=" ")
        num-=1
    print()

1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
    1

﻿
Input

The input will be a single line containing an integer representing N.

Output

The output should be N rows containing numbers starting from 1 as an Inverted Pyramid shown in the sample output.

Explanation

For example, if the given number is 5,
• Print the numbers on 5 rows as shown in the given image.
