01. Greater than Five - 2

Write a program that reads three numbers A B, and C, and checks if each of the given numbers is greater than 5.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer representing A.

The third line of input contains an integer representing C.

Output
The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if each of the given 
numbers is greater than 5, otherwise False should be printed.
