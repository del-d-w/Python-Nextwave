Question: Sum of List Elements
Given a list of numbers, write a program to print the sum of the numbers in the list.
Input: The first line of input will contain space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the list.
Output: The output should be a single line containing the sum of the integers in the given list.
Example: If the given string is "2 5 10 -15 3", your code should print the sum of the given list elements. So the output should be 5.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input and split the numbers into a list.
Initialize a variable to store the sum of the list elements.
Calculate the sum of the list elements using a loop.
Print the sum.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
First, we need to read the input and split the numbers into a list. We can use the input() function to read the input and the split() function to split the numbers.

Step 2: Initialize the sum variable
Next, we need to initialize a variable to store the sum of the list elements. We can set the initial value of the sum to 0.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the list elements
Now, we need to calculate the sum of the list elements. We can use a for loop to iterate through the list and add each number to the sum variable.

Step 4: Print the sum
Finally, we need to print the sum of the list elements. We can use the print() function to print the sum.

Sample Input 1:

2 5 10 -15 3

Sample Output 1:

5

Sample Input 2:

-50 20 3 88 17 3 11 200 1800

Sample Output 2:

2092

Solution:

numbers = input()
num_list = numbers.split()
list_sum = 0
for number in num_list:
    list_sum = list_sum + int(number)
print(list_sum)

Question: Divisible by 3
Approach
Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
Step 2: Create an empty list for divisible numbers
Step 3: Check if each number is divisible by 3
Step 4: Print the list of divisible numbers

Question: Divisible by 3
In this coding question, you are given a list of space-separated numbers. Your task is to write a program that prints a list containing 
the given numbers that are divisible by 3.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input and split the numbers into a list.
Create an empty list to store the numbers divisible by 3.
Check if each number in the list is divisible by 3, and if it is, add it to the new list.
Print the list of numbers divisible by 3.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers
First, we need to read the input, which is a single line containing space-separated integers. We can use the input() function to read the input 
and then use the split() method to split the numbers into a list.

Step 2: Create an empty list for divisible numbers
Next, we need to create an empty list that will store the numbers divisible by 3. We can do this by creating a new list called divisible_by_3_list.

Step 3: Check if each number is divisible by 3
Now, we need to check if each number in the numbers_list is divisible by 3. We can do this by using a for loop to iterate through the list and 
using the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, we add the number to the divisible_by_3_list.

Step 4: Print the list of divisible numbers
Finally, we need to print the list of numbers divisible by 3. We can do this by using the print() function and passing the divisible_by_3_list as an argument.

Sample Input 1:

3 10 9 11 18 20

Sample Output 1:

[3, 9, 18]

Sample Input 2:

300 485 142 1596

Sample Output 2:

[300, 1596]

Solution:

numbers = input()
numbers_list = numbers.split()
divisible_by_3_list = []
for number in numbers_list:
    number = int(number)
    if number % 3 == 0:
        divisible_by_3_list += [number]
print(divisible_by_3_list)

Given a sentence S. The words in the sentence S are separated by a space.
Write a program that prints a new string by joining the third letter of each word in the sentence with the comma(,).

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Read the input sentence.
Split the sentence into words.
Find the third letter of each word.
Join the third letters with a comma.
Print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input sentence

Step 2: Split the sentence into words
Now, we need to split the sentence into words. We can use the split() function to do this. It will create a list of words called string_list.

Step 3: Find the third letter of each word
Next, we need to find the third letter of each word in the string_list. We can use a for loop to iterate through each word in the list. If the length 
of the word is greater than 2, we can get the third letter using the index 2 (since Python uses zero-based indexing). We will store the third letters 
in a new list called result.

Step 4: Join the third letters with a comma
Now that we have the third letters of each word in the result list, we need to join them with a comma. We can use the join() function to do this.

        character = word[2]
        result += [character]
