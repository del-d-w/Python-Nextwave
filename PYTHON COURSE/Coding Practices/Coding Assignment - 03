01. Top 10 Rankers

Write a program that reads the rank of a student R and checks if R is less than 10.
Print HONOR STUDENT if R is less than 10. Otherwise, print NORMAL STUDENT.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing an integer representing R.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. HONOR STUDENT should be printed if R 
is less than 10. Otherwise, NORMAL STUDENT should be printed.
﻿
Explanation:

For example, if the given rank is R = 1, the output should be HONOR STUDENT as 1 is less than 10.
For example, if the given rank is R = 15, the output should be NORMAL STUDENT as 15 is not less than 10.

Sample Input1 :

1

Sample Output 1:

HONOR STUDENT

Sample Input 2:

15

Sample Output 2:

NORMAL STUDENT

Solution:

rank=input()
rank=int(rank)
if rank<10:
  print("HONOR STUDENT")  
else:
 print("NORMAL STUDENT")

02.﻿ Sum or Product

Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks if the sum of A and B is less than 10.
Print the sum of A and B if the sum of A and B is less than 10. Otherwise, print the product of A and B.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing A. 
The second line of input contains an integer representing B.
﻿
Output:

The output should be a single line containing an integer. The sum of A and B should be printed 
if the sum of A and B is less than 10. Otherwise, the product of A and B should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given numbers are A = 1 and B = 2,
✓ The sum of A and B is less than 10. (Sum of A and B is 3 (1 + 2 = 3). 3 is less than 10)
The output should be 3 (1 + 2 = 3) as the sum of A and B is less than 10.

﻿For example, if the given numbers are A = 42 and B = 10,
X The sum of A and B is less than 10. (Sum of A and B is 52 ( 42 + 10 = 52 ). 52 is not less than 10)
The output should be 420 ( 42* 10 = 420) as the sum of A and B is not less than 10.

Sample Input1 :

1
2

Sample Output 1:

3

Sample Input 2:

42
10

Sample Output 2:

420

Solution:

A=input()
A=int(A)
B=input()
B=int(B)
C=A+B
D=A*B
if C<10:
  print(C)  
else:
 print(D)

03.﻿ Discount

Write a program that reads two coupon codes A and B and checks if the first three characters
of one of the coupon codes is equal to "DIS".

Print Discount if the first three characters of one of the coupon codes is equal to "DIS". Otherwise, print No Discount.

Input:

The first line of input contains a string representing A.
The second line of input contains a string representing B.
﻿
Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. Discount should be printed if the first
three characters of one of the coupon codes is equal to "DIS". Otherwise, No Discount should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given coupon codes are A = "DISA9#5" and B = "6BY@X"
✓ The first three characters of A is equal to "DIS". (The first three characters of "DISA9#5" is "DIS". 
"DIS" is equal to "DIS")
X The first three characters of B is equal to "DIS". (The first three characters of "6BY@X" is "6BY".
"6BY" is not equal to "DIS")

The output should be Discount as the first three characters of A is equal to "DIS".

Sample Input1 :

DISA9#5
6BY@X

Sample Output 1:

Discount

Sample Input 2:

17F
DVC&SN

Sample Output 2:

No Discount

Solution:

a=input()
b=input()
if a[:3]=="DIS" or b[:3]=="DIS":
    print("Discount")
else:
    print("No Discount")

04. ﻿Qualified or Not Qualified

Write a program that reads the marks M in Maths and marks P in Physics and checks if both M and P 
are greater than 35 or sum of M and P is greater than or equal to 100.

Print Qualified if both M and P are greater than 35 or sum of M and P is greater than or equal to 100.
Otherwise, print Not Qualified.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing M. The second line of input contains an integer representing P.
﻿
Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. Qualified should be printed if both M and P 
are greater than 35 or sum of M and P is greater than or equal to 100. Otherwise, Not Qualified should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given marks are M = 50 and P = 40,
✓ Both M and P are greater than 35. (50 and 40 are greater than 35)
× Sum of M and P is greater than or equal to 100.( 50+ 40 = 90, 90 is not greater than or equal to 100)

The output should be Qualified as both M and P are greater than 35.

Sample Input1 :

50
40

Sample Output 1:

Qualified

Sample Input 2:

30
49

Sample Output 2:

Not Qualified

Solution:

m=int(input())
p=int(input())
if (m>35 and p>35) or(m+p)>=100:
    print("Qualified")
else:
    print("Not Qualified")

05. ﻿Valid Number

Write a program that reads a three-digit number N and checks if both the given conditions are satisfied.

• Any of the digits of N is not equal to 5
• N is between 300 and 700

Print Valid Number if both the given conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, print Not a Valid Number.

﻿Input:

The input will be a single line containing a three-digit integer representing N.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing a string. Valid Number should be printed if both
the given conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, Not a Valid Number should be printed.
﻿
Explanation:

For example, if the given three-digit number is N = 653,
✓ Any of the digits of N is not equal to 5. (Digits of N are 6, 5 and 3. 6, 3 are not equal to 5)
✓ N is between 300 and 700. (653 is between 300 and 700)

The output should be Valid Number as both the given conditions are satisfied.

Sample Input1 :

653

Sample Output 1:

Valid Number

Sample Input 2:

947

Sample Output 2:

Not a Valid Number

Solution:

n=input()
if not(int(n[0])==5 and int(n[1])==5 and int(n[2])==5) and 300<int(n)<700:
    print("Valid Number")
else:
    print("Not a Valid Number")

06. ﻿Between 9 and 21

Write a program that reads three numbers A, B, and C and checks if any of the given numbers is between 9 and 21.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer representing A. The second line of input contains
an integer representing B. The third line of input contains an integer representing C.

﻿Output:

The output should be a single line containing a boolean. True should be printed if any of the given
numbers is between 9 and 21. Otherwise, False should be printed.

Explanation:

For example, if the given numbers are A = 2, B = 4, and C = 16,
× A is between 9 and 21. (2 is not between 9 and 21)
x B is between 9 and 21. (4 is not between 9 and 21)
✓ C is between 9 and 21. (16 is between 9 and 21)

The output should be True as one of the given numbers is between 9 and 21.

Sample Input1 :

2
4
16

Sample Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

2
4
6

Sample Output 2:

False

Solution:

a=input()
b=input()
c=input()
a=int(a)
b=int(b)
c=int(c)
d =  10<= a <=20 or 10 <= b <= 20 or 10 <= c <= 20 
print(d)
